### Deep Concept Explanations (The "Why")

#### 1. GEX (Gamma Exposure)

* **What is it?** It measures how much Market Makers (the banks) need to hedge.
* **The Logic:**
* **Positive GEX:** Dealers buy when price drops and sell when price rises. This **stabilizes** the market (low volatility).
* **Negative GEX:** Dealers sell when price drops and buy when price rises. This **accelerates** the market (high volatility/crashes).


* **How to use it:** If Nifty is at 24,000 and the GEX is highly Negative, expect a violent move. If Positive, expect a boring, choppy day.

#### 2. Short Covering vs. Long Buildup

* **Long Buildup:** Healthy buying. People are buying expecting it to go up.
* **Short Covering:** Panic buying. People who sold earlier are *losing money* and are forced to buy back to exit. **This causes the fastest rallies.**
* *Code Signal:* Price Green + OI Red.



#### 3. Delta & Gamma

* **Delta:** Speed. If Delta is 0.5, and Nifty moves 10 points, option moves 5 points.
* **Gamma:** Acceleration. As Nifty moves, Delta changes. Gamma tells you *how fast* Delta changes. High Gamma (on expiry day) means "Gamma Blast" risk/reward.
