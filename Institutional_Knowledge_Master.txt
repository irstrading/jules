3. MASTER TRADING RULES
-----------------------
• STOCK V INDEX: Index GEX = Dealer game | Stock GEX = Operator + Dealer hybrid
• LIQUIDITY FILTER: Only use GEX on Tier-1 stocks (Reliance, HDFC, etc.)
• IV REGIME SWING: For swing (1-5 days) → avoid falling IV

4. STOCK BEHAVIORS
------------------
• RELIANCE: Often used to hold Nifty when other sectors are falling.
• HDFCBANK: Key driver for Bank Nifty; 1% move here is significant.
• INFY: Sensitive to US economic data and Nasdaq performance.
• ITC: Considered a defensive stock; often rises when market is uncertain.
• TATAMOTORS: High volatility, sensitive to global JLR sales and auto policy.
